## About <a name = "about"></a>
A simple image classification project to classify images of hand gestures. Dataset was taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sprakash08/hand-gestures-recognition/). Here I use deep learning to classify the images.

## Prerequisites
Here I mainly use TensorFlow. To use the code, please make sure that the packages on your machine are compatible with the packages mentioned in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
